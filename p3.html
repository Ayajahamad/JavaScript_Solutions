        let drive = (old >= 18)?"you can drive" : "No you cannot drive";
        console.log(drive);

        // 1. Arithmetic Operators:
        //     a) Write a JavaScript function to calculate the area of a rectangle given its width and height.

        function areaOfRect(length, breadth){
            return length*breadth;
        }
        console.log("The area of rectangle is: " + areaOfRect(6,7));

        // b) Create a function that takes two numbers as input and returns their sum, difference, product, and quotient as an object.
