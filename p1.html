    <h1>Javascript Variables</h1>
    <p> JS Is a Dynamically typed Langauge, RunTime - (no need to declare variable type)</p>
    <p>Variables are like a Containers</p>
    <h3>Rules for choosing variables</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>letters, digits,underscores and $ sign is allowed.</li>
        <li>Must begin with a $, _ , or a Letter.</li>
        <li>JS reserved words are cannot be used.</li>
        <li>Case sensitive (A & a is different).</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Declare using 3 of 1 keywords</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>var</li>
        <li>let</li>
        <li>const</li>
    </ol>
    <ul>
        <li>var - Old type (Used Before ES6)</li>
        <li>var is Globally scoped</li>
        <li>let and cont are block scoped</li>
        <li>var can be updated redelared within it's scope</li>
        <li>let can be updated but not redeclared</li>
        <li>const can neither be updated nor be redeclared.</li>
        <li>first Declare-and-Initialize</li>
        <li>var - don't use <br>
            let - use less <br>
            const - use more</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Certainly! Here are some basic questions on JavaScript variables for you to solve: <br><br>

        1. Write a program that declares two variables, `num1` and `num2`, and assigns them values. Calculate the sum of these two variables and store the result in a variable called `sum`. Finally, display the value of `sum` in the console. <br><br>
        
        2. Write a program that declares three variables, `length`, `width`, and `height`, and assigns them values representing the dimensions of a rectangular box. Calculate the volume of the box by multiplying the three variables, and store the result in a variable called `volume`. Display the value of `volume` in the console. <br><br>
        
        3. Write a program that declares a variable `temperature` and assigns it a numerical value representing the temperature in Celsius. Convert this temperature to Fahrenheit and store the result in a variable called `fahrenheit`. Display the value of `fahrenheit` in the console. <br><br>
        
        4. Write a program that declares two variables, `firstName` and `lastName`, and assigns them string values representing a person's first and last name. Concatenate these two variables to create a full name and store it in a variable called `fullName`. Display the value of `fullName` in the console. <br><br>
        
        5. Write a program that declares a variable `age` and assigns it a numerical value representing a person's age. Determine if the person is an adult (age 18 or above) and store the result in a variable called `isAdult`. Display the value of `isAdult` in the console. <br><br>
        
        These questions involve basic calculations, string concatenation, and logical operations using variables in JavaScript. Solve them by writing the necessary code and executing the programs to get the expected output.</h5>

        // 1. Write a program that declares two variables, `num1` and `num2`, and assigns them values. Calculate the sum of these two variables and store the result in a variable called `sum`. Finally, display the value of `sum` in the console.

        let num1 = 5;
        let num2 = 4;
        let sum = num1 + num2;
        console.log("The sum of 2 number is: " + sum);

        // 2. Write a program that declares three variables, `length`, `width`, and `height`, and assigns them values representing the dimensions of a rectangular box. Calculate the volume of the box by multiplying the three variables, and store the result in a variable called `volume`. Display the value of `volume` in the console.

        const length = 15;
        const width = 10;
        const height = 5;
        const volume = length * width * height;
        console.log("The volume of the box is: "+volume + " cm^3")

        // 3. Write a program that declares a variable `temperature` and assigns it a numerical value representing the temperature in Celsius. Convert this temperature to Fahrenheit and store the result in a variable called `fahrenheit`. Display the value of `fahrenheit` in the console.

        const temperature = 38;
        const fahrenheit = temperature*(9/5) + 32;
        console.log("Fahrenheit is "+ fahrenheit+"F");

        // 4. Write a program that declares two variables, `firstName` and `lastName`, and assigns them string values representing a person's first and last name. Concatenate these two variables to create a full name and store it in a variable called `fullName`. Display the value of `fullName` in the console.

        let firstName = "Ayaz";
        let lastName = " Ahamad";
        let fullName ="The fullName of the person is: "+ firstName + lastName;
        console.log(fullName);

        // 5. Write a program that declares a variable `age` and assigns it a numerical value representing a person's age. Determine if the person is an adult (age 18 or above) and store the result in a variable called `isAdult`. Display the value of `isAdult` in the console.

        const age = 19;
        if(age >= 18){
            let isAdult = age;
            console.log("The age is "+ isAdult +" person isAdult")
            console.log(isAdult);
        }
